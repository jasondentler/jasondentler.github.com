<p>Gabriel Schener’s new book, <a href="http://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2011/08/29/nhibernate-3-beginners-guide-published/" target="_blank">NHibernate 3 Beginner’s Guide</a> was published today. Go check it out. Gabriel knows NHibernate inside and out – certainly better than me – and worked hard to give the community the best book possible. For technical reviewers, he was backed up by two of the best:Fabio Maulo and Jose Romaniello.</p>  <p>Disclosure: Gabriel was an amazing technical reviewer on my book, NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook, along with Jose, <a href="http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/">Fabio</a>, and Tuna Toksoz. Packt Publishing published both NHibernate 3 Beginner’s Guide and <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/nhibernate-3-0-cookbook/book?utm_source=jasondentler.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=authorsite&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_004974">NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook</a>.</p>
