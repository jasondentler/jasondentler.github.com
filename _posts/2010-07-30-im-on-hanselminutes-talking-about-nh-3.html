<p>Our friend <a href="http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Fabio</a> was up to no good earlier this week, and as a result, I ended up on <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com" target="_blank">Hanselminutes</a> talking about NHibernate 3 with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>. </p>  <p>We talk about where to get <a href="http://nhforge.org" target="_blank">NHibernate</a>, a quick overview of starting an NH app, the state of NHForge, tooling and commercial support, the NHibernate ecosystem, and we compare the new EF “unicorn” features to features in NHibernate.</p>  <p>So, <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=243" target="_blank">go listen now</a>. </p>  <p>Thank you Scott, Fabio, and the guys at Pwop! I think the show turned out great, despite my nerves.</p>
