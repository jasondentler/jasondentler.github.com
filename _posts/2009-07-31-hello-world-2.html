Hi boys and girls. Today, we're going to talk about computer programming, technology, and <del style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">surviving</del> thriving in an IT department.

As you might have guessed by the blog title, I'm a fan of BASIC programming languages. I've been programming on PCs since about 4th grade when I first started tinkering with BASIC on my family's 286 IBM PC clone running DOS 3.3. The language has come a long way since line numbers and GOSUBs.

Just to be clear, I'm not one of those VB weenies who makes a living by hammering out form after form with drag-and-drop designers. I write code. I create. I use the whole language, not just the clicky-widgets and IDE dohickeys.

So, stay tuned for some great info on advanced Visual Basic.NET, and programming and technology in general.
