When I posted last night, I had exactly zero RSS subscribers and one twitter follower – a family member. I woke up this morning to find I had blog comments, RSS subscribers, and twitter followers. People – not just people, programmers - actually read that mess I posted. The pressure is on now.</p>  <p>So, thank you ScottGu for the great press! The second post in the series will be coming shortly.</p>
