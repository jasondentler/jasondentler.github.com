<p>You may have noticed a lack of VB.NET source code on my blog recently. There’s a reason. I’ve always been able to read and write C#. at least enough to order off the menu or ask for directions to the Men’s room. </p>  <p>The ALT.NET crowd is almost exclusively C#, except where they’ve moved beyond it.&#160; If I’m going to participate, it’s past time for me to become fluent. Until at least April, I won’t write a single line of VB.NET outside of work. </p>
