We're hiring another Senior .NET Developer to add to our team of six. Here's a few things you should know about us:

 * _We enjoy working._

	We have fun at work. We geek out a lot.

 * _We enjoy learning._

	We read books and blogs. We try out new ideas. We share what we learn.

 * _We question "best practices."_

	We use Mercurial, not TFS. We use NHibernate, not EF. We're not afraid of open source. We use what works best.

Here's a few things we want to know about you:

 * _Can you code?_

	In addition to hammering out some C#, SQL, and a little JavaScript, you can navigate Visual Studio with ease. Not only do you understand recursion and simple set algebra, but you know when and how to use them in your code.

 * _Are you a good fit?_

	We want to know what makes you unique and interesting. You should fit well with the team.
