<p>There’s a new <a href="http://nhforge.org/">NHibernate</a> book on the market: <a href="http://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2011/08/29/nhibernate-3-beginners-guide-published/" target="_blank">NHibernate 3 Beginner’s Guide</a> by Gabriel Schenker. Gabriel is the guy behind the now-offline NHibernate FAQ site. For years, it was one of the best sites on the subject.</p>  <p>His style is straight forward and simple. It’s a surprisingly quick read, with all the right information to get up to speed on NHibernate quickly. He’s careful not to leave the reader wondering about key terms or jumping ahead to understand concepts. </p>  <p>It’s more than just an update to the 2.x version. Gabriel has rewritten this book <strong>from scratch</strong> and avoided all of the issues of the previous book. Most importantly, he takes a <strong>model-first approach</strong>. This is the beginner’s guide I would share with my coworkers, and, in fact, I have. You should absolutely buy this book for your team.</p>
