I asked if I could recreate his Chinook Media Manager app with MVC and CQRS as an example for this new project. As usual, he pointed me to something even better: Restbucks, the example from the <a href="http://restinpractice.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">REST in Practice</a> book. </p>  <p>Jose has <a href="http://restbuckson.net/" target="_blank">already implemented this</a> example in .NET as a full REST (HATEOAS) service using WCF over a traditional <a href="http://nhforge.org/">NHibernate</a> model.</p>  <p>I set off to build it over using CQRS. I started with nCQRS, but they’ve had string of bad pull requests applied recently. After 2 days of hacking at the framework to get a build and all-green tests, I switched to Greg Young’s 100-line SimpleCQRS. From there, it was smooth sailing again.</p>  <p>So, I give you the <a href="https://github.com/jasondentler/cqrs#readme" target="_blank">“Did you mean CarsBucks?” example</a>, Restbucks reimagined as a CQRS domain.</p>  <p>I may not know exactly what I’m doing, but I’m doing it anyway. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Also, this may deviate from Restbucks slightly. I’m not finished with the book.</p>  <p><font size="1">(Coffee cup image licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 by Marcelo Alves)</font></p>
