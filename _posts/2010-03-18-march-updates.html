<h5>Some news from the month of March. </h5>  <p>Simon Duduica of Bucharest, Romania and his team are porting Hibernate Envers to .NET / <a href="http://nhforge.org" target="_blank">NHibernate</a>. </p>  <p>Michele Minorello is working on NHibernate Search to add Loquacious configuration and Linq2Lucene. </p>  <p>I have a book deal with Packt Publishing. <u>NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook</u> will cover existing and new 3.0 features of NHibernate, as a series of short, easy to follow recipes that can be combined to build great NHibernate applications. In addition to NHibernate 3, the book also covers NHContrib projects, some ideas from uNHAddIns, fluent &amp; auto-mapping with Fluent NHibernate, and ConfORM.</p>
<p>I'd like to send a HUGE thank you to my technical reviewers, including Fabio Maulo, Jose Romaniello, and Tuna Toksoz.</p>
