We all know [GitHub](http://github.com) rocks. Seriously. Now they get to host my blog. [Here's the source](http://github.com/jasondentler/jasondentler.github.com), including my awesome rake file. ;)

Finally, Two Tone Cadillac by T-Bird and the Breaks rocks. Seriously. [Give it a listen.](http://amzn.com/B001R36GO8)
