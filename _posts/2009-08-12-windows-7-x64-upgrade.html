Today, I'm upgrading my PC to Windows 7 64-bit. So far, the process has been quick and painless - which is pretty much the best possible outcome for system upgrades (and medical tests).

Evidently I forgot to copy my music collection up to the file server before blowing away my partition. I guess I'll be re-ripping this afternoon. Now I remember why I always spend the extra $2 to buy a physical CD from Amazon instead of just the bits.

Anywho. I'll be looking in to cloud backup solutions before I attempt anything like this at home. If anyone has suggestions, I'm open to ideas.
