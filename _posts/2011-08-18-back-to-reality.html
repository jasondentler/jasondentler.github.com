<p><strong>CONTAINS 0% CODE. WARNING: MAY CONTAIN FEELINGS.</strong></p>  <p>Ryan Hartzog has been trying to recruit me for the past 8 months. As he put it, he wore me down. At the end of the month, I leave the college to go to work for David Weekley Homes. </p>  <p>Here’s a few things that stuck with me:</p>  <ol>   <li>It’s not “Human Resources” it’s “People.”</li>    <li>When I arrived, the receptionist greeted me by name, knew exactly who I was to meet, where I should be, and when I should be there.</li>    <li>The interview &amp; assessment process began at 9am and lasted well in to the afternoon. If they go through all this effort for everyone, they must be picky about who they select.</li>    <li>The all-day interview process never felt grueling. I lost count of the number of times I was offered a beverage or asked if I needed a break.</li>    <li>The team invited me in. We cut up and had a good time. I found a fellow Sci-Fi fan. Someone on the team has an aversion to Asian cuisine, and another to glitter. I was introduced to “Evil Donna,” who, it turns out, is not evil after all.</li>    <li>By the end of the day, it was pretty clear these people enjoy their jobs and each other. I didn’t hear a grumble or see a frown all day, even in passing. </li>    <li>They pushed through the process as quickly as possible (at my request), always set clear expectations, and were prompt in making an offer.</li> </ol>  <p>I’m heading back to “the real world.”</p>
